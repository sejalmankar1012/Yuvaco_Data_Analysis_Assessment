## Description

The assignment involves working as a data analyst at a firm that deals with the delivery of goods and packages. You are provided with a dataset representing packages with attributes such as weight, distance, and delivery type. You are also given a cost grid that specifies the cost calculation parameters for different delivery types. The task is to calculate the cost of each package delivery using this data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Python script for calculating package delivery costs, you'll need the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- Access to a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (recommended).

### Running the Code

1. Open a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

2. Copy the Python script provided in the assignment and paste it into a code cell.

3. Run the code cell to execute the script.

## Output

The Python script will calculate the cost of each package delivery based on the provided data and the cost grid. It will then save the calculated costs in an output file named 'package_costs.csv'.

You can access the output file to view the calculated costs for each package.

## Google Colab Notebook

To run the provided Python script in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Colab at [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. Create a new notebook or open an existing one.

3. Create a new code cell in the Colab notebook.

4. Paste the Python script into the code cell.

5. Run the code cell to execute the script.

The output file 'package_costs.csv' will be saved in your Google Colab environment, and you can download it as needed.
